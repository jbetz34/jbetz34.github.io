## Hi! 
  My name is James, I am a software developer with specialization in database engineering. 
Nearly 4 years ago, during my first job after college, I stumbled into a humble programming
language called q/kdb+. Although designed for database management and high frequency event
processing, I enjoy using the language to design applications that would not typically be
deployed with q/kdb+. 

  I hope to use this website to share some of the fun projects/applications that I have built 
as well as sharing my thoughts on some related, interesting topics. 

  All code displayed on this site was written personally during my free time, or borrowed from
open source repositories. None of the code or ideas expressed on this site are my own and 
have no influence from current or previous employment. 

Enjoy :)
