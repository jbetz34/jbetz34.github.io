## Hi! 
My name is James, I am a software developer with specialization in database engineering. I started this website as a learning tool to advance my coding skills (especially in front end development), to show off some of my cool side projects and have a little bit of fun as well. 

Nearly 4 years ago, during my first job after college, I stumbled into a humble programming language called q/kdb+. Although designed for database management and high frequency event processing, I enjoy using the language to design applications that would not typically be deployed with q/kdb+. Don't be surprised if the majority of the content on this site pertains directly to q/kdb+ and related applications, it is my primary coding language and one I use everyday in my work. 

I hope to use this website to share some of the fun projects/applications that I have built as well as sharing my thoughts on some related, interesting topics. I am constantly changing my mind and trying to improve what I have built, this site will be no different. So do not be surprized if the layout or content in this site changes faster than the weather. 

Enjoy :)
