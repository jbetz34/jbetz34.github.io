This page is called: {{ page.title }} and it is where I can add content and custom {{ "front matter" | upcase }} to the homepage

Here's what I want to do:
- Create a beautiful/fun landing page
- Move the posts to a different tab
- Create a projects tab
- Find a way to move this onto the Github pages site
