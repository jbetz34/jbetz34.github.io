**Projects vs. Blogs**
Projects are posts where I will set out a goal for the development session and attempt to reach the goal in the writing. 
They will typically be code based, have a link to code that users can view and would be awesome with a front end interface. 
Blogs are posts where I will speak about a specific piece of code or behavior of the code. The goal in these writings is to make a user think about code differently, or to educate them on some cool aspects. 

Big part of this is figuring out how to host code where users can interact
- Front end app to all projects? 
- How will I host code?
